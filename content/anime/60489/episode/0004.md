Episode 4 immediately plunges into chaos as Marina’s corpse is publicly discovered, forcing Takopi, Azuma, and Shizuka to confront the mounting consequences of their actions. The secret cover-up is revealed, and reality begins to sink in, with authorities investigating and closing in on the trio. This discovery marks a critical turning point for all three main characters.

The discovery intensifies Azuma’s internal struggle and guilt for helping to conceal the murder, pushing him to the brink of a mental breakdown. He feels suffocated by the immense pressure from his mother, a doctor who demands absolute perfection; anything less than a 100% on a test, such as a 93 or even a 53, is seen as a "failure". This relentless standard fosters deep resentment and jealousy towards his older brother, Junya, who seemingly achieves everything effortlessly. The episode vividly portrays Azuma's psychological distress, using extreme fisheye shots and disturbing imagery to show his world literally closing in on him. In a particularly heartbreaking moment, after he gets a bad score, his mother tells him she has "given up on him", shattering his desire to impress her further. He feels completely broken, unloved, and convinced he has no one left.

Throughout Azuma's turmoil, Shizuka remains disturbingly unfazed by Marina's death and the impending consequences. Her singular focus is on reaching Tokyo to find her dog, Chappy, the last thing her father left her. She actively, and some argue manipulatively, presses Azuma to take the blame for Marina's assassination, promising to "wait for him" while she goes to find Chappy. This behavior highlights a significant lack of empathy, potentially stemming from her own severe trauma and isolation, which may lead her to treat Azuma almost like her dog, Chappy. Azuma's strong attachment to Shizuka is partly fueled by his "mommy issues", as he perceives her double eyelids to perfectly resemble his mother's, a key factor in his desperate desire to gain her approval. He desperately seeks validation, and Shizuka's "acknowledgments" make him feel needed and give him a "role".

Meanwhile, Takopi, once an alien oblivious to human emotions, continues his journey of understanding guilt, grief, and responsibility. He recognizes the unsustainability of the cover-up and tries to convince Shizuka to tell the truth and take accountability, but his pleas are largely ignored. The weight of their actions and the increasing complexity of human suffering seem to overwhelm the cheerful alien, leaving him confused and panicking.

As Azuma, feeling utterly alone and believing himself to be a "failure", prepares to turn himself in for Shizuka's sake, his older brother, Junya, intervenes. Azuma initially perceives his brother as a monstrous, imposing figure, expecting condemnation and accusations of ruining the family. However, Junya offers profound empathy and unconditional support, pulling Azuma into a hug and assuring him that he is there to listen and help. Junya reveals his own imperfections, admitting he "sucks at Monster Hunter" and that their mother's pancakes, which Azuma so desperately sought as a symbol of his mother's love, are "terrible". This pivotal scene brings Azuma out of the shadows, allowing him to unburden himself and find solace in his brother's acceptance, a beacon of light in a dark world.

Empowered by Junya's support, Azuma confesses his involvement in covering up Marina's death to the police. However, the authorities suspect he was coerced, leading them to identify Shizuka as the primary suspect for manipulating him. Unaware or unconcerned about these developments, Shizuka, still fixated on finding Chappy in Tokyo, prepares to escape with Takopi, leaving the fate of the investigation uncertain as the episode concludes.

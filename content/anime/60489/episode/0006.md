As Azuma confronts Takopi, his demeanor a blend of sadness and newfound resolve, he explains that the ongoing investigation means he can no longer see Shizuka, and his family is enduring immense pressure. Takopi, overcome with sorrow, cries at this news. Moved by Takopi's empathy, Azuma too breaks down, expressing heartfelt gratitude. He admits that despite his own self-doubt, Takopi consistently praised him as "smart". He cherished their time together, finding joy in school and friendship when the trio was united. As a gesture of thanks, Azuma returns all of Takopi's Happy Gadgets.

Before leaving, Azuma reveals his new glasses were bought with his older brother Junya's last paycheck, as Junya lost his job, possibly jeopardizing his college plans, due to the fallout from the Marina investigation. This highlights Junya's immense sacrifice and support for Azuma. Azuma then makes a poignant request to Takopi: if he ever encounters Azuma's younger self through the time machine, he should tell him it's "okay to fight with your big bro". This marks Azuma's significant development, as he finally acknowledges his brother's unconditional love, realizing Shizuka had been manipulating him for her own purposes.

After weeks of waiting in the park, Shizuka finally arrives, consumed by rage and despair. Takopi attempts to apologize for his failures and inability to understand her, but Shizuka is too furious to listen. In a raw, uninhibited breakdown, she lashes out, questioning Takopi and the world. She vents years of bottled-up frustration, asking "What am I supposed to do? Nobody taught me what to do!". She highlights her father's abandonment, her mother's neglect, and the lack of any parental figure to guide her, protect her, or even tell her to bathe when she stinks.

As Shizuka beats Takopi, her actions mirror Marina's cruelty towards her, underscoring the series' theme of "hurt people hurt people". Takopi, unable to offer solutions, can only apologize for his inability to understand human suffering. Amidst her wails, she finally breaks down crying on Takopi's shoulder, a long-awaited moment of vulnerability and connection. They wander together, sharing what little money Shizuka has for bread, a silent testament to their bond.

Returning to the park, Takopi shows Shizuka the broken Happy Camera and the picture they once took together. He reveals that despite its damaged state, he can use his remaining "happy powers" to make it work one last time, an act that requires him to sacrifice his very existence. Shizuka realizes his intent too late as Takopi begins to disappear before her eyes, his existence fading to create a new reality.

The reset creates a new timeline, one where Takopi never existed, yet his presence subtly lingers. This is not a "fairy tale ending" where all problems vanish; the parents remain "dirtbags", and the children's struggles are still present. However, Takopi's sacrifice creates a crucial shift: the children are no longer alone.

In this altered 2016 timeline: Marina and Shizuka are still at odds initially, but a doodle of Takopi in Shizuka's notebook becomes a catalyst for their bond. Both find it "stupid and useless" and something that would "talk all the time," and they cry at the loss of something they cannot remember, creating a shared understanding. This leads to a developing friendship where they can even playfully jab at each other's troubled families, a sign of their closeness. Marina still carries a scar on her face, and their home lives remain challenging, but they have each other. Crucially, Chappy is alive. Azuma is no longer fixated on Shizuka for validation. He has found a group of friends and has a healthier relationship with his older brother, with whom he now comfortably fights over video games, fulfilling his earlier wish.

Takopi's narration guides the audience through this new reality, offering a final, emotional farewell to Shizuka and hoping she, Marina, and Azuma will grow and reach adulthood together. The series concludes with a post-credits scene showing Shizuka and Marina as high schoolers, shopping and enjoying each other's company. They find a pen that vaguely reminds them of Takopi's gadgets, a lingering "residual memory" of his sacrifice.

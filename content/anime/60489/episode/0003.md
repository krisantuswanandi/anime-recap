The eerie calm after the storm of Marina’s brutal death was quickly shattered as Azuma, driven by worry for Shizuka, discovered them in the forest. His eyes, once full of warmth, lost their light upon seeing Marina’s lifeless body on the ground. Azuma struggled to comprehend how Shizuka could remain so composed. Shizuka chillingly suggested she would simply go to a juvenile facility. However, the weight of her actions, particularly the thought of not seeing Chappy again if she were sent away, began to sink in, prompting her to seek another solution.

Shizuka, with an intensity that touched Azuma, begged for his help to hide Marina's body, emphasizing that he was her only friend. Feeling needed, Azuma acquiesced, devising a plan to conceal Marina's body within one of Takopi's size-changing Happy Gadgets – a capsule. The audacious scheme involved Takopi transforming and pretending to be Marina, attending her school and living in her home to avoid suspicion. Though Takopi questioned the drastic measure, Shizuka ultimately convinced him to go through with it.

The immediate aftermath saw Takopi, now in Marina’s form, enter a household rife with chaos. Marina’s parents were so consumed by their incessant fighting that they barely registered his presence. Her father even mistakenly injured Takopi’s nose by throwing something at him, yet the argument continued unabated. This dysfunctional environment, along with his inability to fully grasp the human conflicts, meant Takopi remained somewhat oblivious to the full extent of the horror he was living.

As days passed, Azuma, Shizuka, and Takopi conspired, their secret bonding them in a twisted loyalty born of shared trauma and complicity. During this time, Azuma's brother, Junya, appeared, seemingly a kind person. However, Azuma resented his part-time job, viewing it as unnecessary and a source of worry for their parents. Junya's goal was to buy a ring for his girlfriend, a purchase Azuma believed could have been made with an allowance. Shizuka, ever manipulative, suggested Azuma steal the ring to shock Junya into quitting his job. Though doubtful, Azuma proceeded when Shizuka expressed her belief in him. Despite Takopi’s help, the theft failed, as Azuma was swayed by memories of his brother’s happiness over the ring and Junya’s promise to buy him something nice. They narrowly escaped using Takopi’s flying gadget.

Azuma's own deep-seated trauma became evident as he reflected on his mother’s unmet promises and her constant perception of him as a failure compared to his brother. This emotional burden caused him to break down in tears before Shizuka and Takopi, a raw, relatable display of vulnerability that grounded the otherwise surreal situation.

Living as Marina, Takopi endured the family's abuse, including a slap from Marina’s mother that nearly made him bleed. However, Marina’s mother, driven by maternal instinct, suddenly collapsed, crying and begging Takopi to return her daughter, realizing he was not her real Marina. This moment was a critical turning point for Takopi. Observing family photos and crying before a mirror, he finally grasped the gravity of his and Shizuka’s actions. He felt deep regret, apologizing to the deceased Marina and resolving to do the right thing.

Meanwhile, Takopi's memory began to show signs of being affected, possibly due to his time-traveling interventions, as he struggled to recall why he couldn't return to Happy Planet. He also realized that the Happy Camera, his time-traveling device, was shattered and useless, meaning no more resets were possible.

The episode culminated in a shocking discovery: Marina’s real body was found in the woods. This pivotal event exposed the children’s perfect cover-up, leaving the identity of who would be implicated uncertain. Azuma’s fingerprints, from handling the capsule and moving Marina’s body, could potentially make him a suspect.

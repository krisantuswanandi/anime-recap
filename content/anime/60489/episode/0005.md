Shizuka radiates pure joy and hope as she and Takopi embark on a journey to Tokyo, a stark contrast to the series' usual bleakness, as she imagines reuniting with her father and beloved dog, Chappy, exploring the vibrant city for the first time. However, this fragile happiness is brutally shattered upon their arrival at her father's apartment building. Her father opens the door, revealing he has remarried and now has two new step-daughters, effectively starting a completely new life. He shockingly pretends not to recognize Shizuka, telling his children he doesn't know why she's calling him "dad". The devastating truth that Chappy was never with him, having died earlier, completely dissolves Shizuka's fantasy.

Heartbroken and abandoned, Shizuka's mind spirals into terrifying delusions. Under a bridge, she rants about her father's new family and grotesquely imagines that they might have eaten Chappy. She desperately begs Takopi for a gadget that can scan the children's stomachs. When Takopi, confused by her warped logic, admits he cannot help, Shizuka, consumed by anguish and a profound sense of betrayal, picks up a rock and attempts to strike him. This violent act is a chilling callback to how Takopi killed Marina, and it showcases Shizuka's complete mental break, reaching a point "beyond saving".

As Shizuka attacks Takopi, the narrative shifts dramatically, plunging into a heartbreaking flashback to Takopi's "first loop" â€“ an entirely different timeline where he first arrived on Earth in 2022 and encountered a teenage Marina, not Shizuka. In this timeline, Marina is isolated and friendless, constantly judged for a massive scar on her face. This scar was inflicted by her mother during a broken glass bottle incident in her childhood, leaving Marina with a phobia of glass. Her mother is depicted in an even worse state than in the current timeline, suffering from severe cognitive decline and mental instability, often berating and threatening Marina.

Takopi, initially called "Dirtball" by Marina, attempts to help her. Marina soon reconnects with Azuma, forming a fragile bond that brings her fleeting happiness. This relationship also brings a brief moment of hope for her mother, who becomes happy at the prospect of Marina finding love. Marina even expresses a desire to have a child someday, hoping it will make her mother happy, unknowingly mimicking the cycle of abuse she experienced.

However, happiness in this story is always temporary. Shizuka transfers to their school, and Azuma, still grappling with his "mommy issues" and drawn to Shizuka's resemblance to his mother, immediately abandons Marina for Shizuka. This betrayal shatters Marina and sends her mother into a violent frenzy, blaming Marina for her abandonment and attacking her, causing fresh scars. In a desperate act of self-defense, Marina kills her mother. Overwhelmed and delusional, she expresses profound regret, wishing she had killed Shizuka back then to prevent her own suffering. Marina then tragically takes her own life using a shard of glass, mirroring the source of her original scar.

Witnessing Marina's despair and her final wish, Takopi decides his new mission is to go back in time to kill Shizuka and make Marina happy. He returns to Planet Happy to use the Great Happiness Clock. However, Happy Mama, his mother on Planet Happy reveals that Takopi has broken the most important rule of their planet by returning alone. She attempts to erase his memories and reborn him as punishment, but Takopi resists, activating the clock as his memories are being wiped away. This explains why Takopi arrived on Earth at the beginning of the series in 2016 with fragmented memories, forgetting his original purpose and the details of Marina's timeline. His true original sin isn't understood as killing, as his mother doesn't comprehend the concept, but rather his violation of the planet's rules regarding spreading happiness and potentially bringing someone back with him.

As Takopi falls back to Earth in the present timeline (where Marina is already dead), his memories partially realign. He is consumed by conflicting emotions, remembering both Marina's suffering caused by Shizuka and Shizuka's own kindness towards him. He initially thinks he must kill Shizuka to bring happiness, but then recalls Marina was not innocent either. This realization highlights the story's theme that the "villain is in the eye of the beholder" and that human emotions are "complicated as hell".

The episode concludes with Takopi in this state of confusion and moral dilemma at the park where his journey began. Suddenly, Azuma appears and calls out to him, with a strange ass expression on his face, leaving the fate of all three children and Takopi's next move uncertain as the series hurtles towards its finale.

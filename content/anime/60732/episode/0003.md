Ryo and Abel trek through the dangerous landscape after their intense Wyvern fights, finally climbing over those notorious Malefic Mountains. Ryo, feeling pretty awesome about his monster-slaying abilities, is ready to take on more Wyverns, while Abel wisely suggests avoiding confrontation if they can help it. Ryo uses the travel time to continue roasting the ridiculously named Debuhi Empire, admitting his dislike is purely based on how goofy the name sounds.

Luckily, they spot a road, and Abel realizes they’re close to civilization, setting a course for the nearest town, Kyatt (or Kailadi). Here comes the biggest Isekai shock of the episode: Ryo finds Curry Rice being served, and it tastes exactly like the curry from his old world. Ryo is completely stunned that his favorite food already exists in this magical land, quickly devouring the plate and ordering another. This discovery, combined with Abel mentioning that this world uses Earth's time metrics (24 hours, 7 days a week) and even centimeters for measurements, makes Ryo realize that maybe a reincarnator came before him and influenced things.

They soon arrive at the long-awaited town of Lune, where the guards and citizens lose their minds when they see Abel alive, believing he had been missing for months. Abel introduces Ryo as his savior. Abel quickly suggests Ryo register with the Adventurer’s Guild, explaining that a guild card works as an ID and helps avoid entry fees in other towns.

At the guild, Abel is instantly recognized as a local hero, being a high-ranking member of the esteemed party, the Crimson Sword. Abel, determined to hook Ryo up, insists he be registered at D-rank, skipping the usual F-rank start. Guildmaster Hugh, initially skeptical, becomes utterly astonished when Abel presents the massive haul of rare, green Wyvern magic stones as proof of Ryo’s strength. Hugh confirms that fighting that many Wyverns, especially down in the deadly Malefic Mountains, proves Ryo is exceptional, immediately approving the D-rank classification.

While Abel is getting teary-eyed catching up with his worried party members, Ryo steps out for some air and bumps into a peculiar Elf girl. She instantly recognizes the distinctive white robe Ryo is wearing, mentioning that it looks like the attire of the Fairy King and complimenting Ryo for having impressed the king so much. Ryo is left completely bewildered, as he doesn't know who the Fairy King is.

Ryo finalizes his paperwork with the receptionist Nina and secures his D-rank card. He also signs up for the introductory dungeon exploration course, which starts in two days, and is assigned to the guild lodgings for the first 300 days. There, he meets his new roommates: Nils, Eto, and Amon, a young 16-year-old orphan forced to become an adventurer.

Meanwhile, Abel is busy bragging to his skeptical party members about Ryo’s phenomenal, impossible magic—like effortlessly using four icicle lances at once without a staff, and crushing Rock Golems with gigantic ice blocks. The party is worried that Ryo might be as dangerous as the legendary Inferno Magician should he turn against them. But Abel reassures them, insisting Ryo is no threat to them because Ryo hates the Debuhi Empire’s name too much to ever side with them. Ryo's "slow life" is officially on hold as he begins his journey as a D-rank adventurer in Lune.

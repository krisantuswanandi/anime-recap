Ryo’s journey as a D-rank adventurer begins officially with the Adventurer’s Guild introductory course in Lune. During the lecture, Ryo, showing advanced insight, asks his instructor if there is a known way to instantly travel to previously cleared dungeon floors. The instructor confirms this feature is rumored to exist in southern dungeons but not in Lune. Ryo and his nervous 16-year-old roommate, Amon, proceed to the first floor of the dungeon for their required training run.

Despite the instructor assuring the new adventurers that the first floor is a safe zone, Ryo quickly senses a monster approaching. They encounter a soldier ant, and Ryo instantly subdues the massive insect by pinning it to the ground using eight icicle lances. Amon, seizing the moment, scores his first kill with a clean slice to the ant’s neck, and Ryo ensures they collect the magic stone as a trophy for their success.

That evening, back in the guild dormitory, Ryo and his roommates discuss the unusual presence of soldier ants on the upper floors. Their discussion is interrupted by the surprise arrival of their famous guarantor, Abel, who explains that the soldier ants are reaching the upper layers by digging tunnels. Abel, confirming his own party's reputation, advises the new adventurers that survival must always be their top priority. Abel’s dramatic reunion with his party, the Crimson Sword, quickly follows, and Ryo watches as Abel is hauled off to report to the Guildmaster, despite Abel’s pleas for Ryo's help. Ryo’s interaction with Abel's party member, Lyn, leaves him confused after she stares at him oddly.

Ryo and Amon continue training in the dungeon, where Ryo, the secret swordsman, observes that Amon's combat style closely resembles Abel's. Amon reveals his teacher, Keero, learned from a prestigious school in the capital. Ryo encourages Amon to build stamina, citing Abel's dedication to morning training as an example, thoroughly motivating the younger adventurer to work hard.

Taking a break from the dungeon, Ryo heads to the library to research alchemy. While outside, the calm atmosphere is violently broken by a sudden total solar eclipse. The surroundings immediately turn eerie, and everyone around Ryo vanishes. Ryo senses an imminent attack and barely manages to block a powerful fire blast with an ice wall.

Emerging from the darkness is a fearsome, horned demon who Ryo quickly identifies as an Akuma. He recognizes the immense power radiating from her, realizing she is on par with rare monsters like the Behemoth or the Griffin. She introduces herself later as Leonore Urraca Alburquerque. Leonore launches a wind bullet that pierces Ryo's ice shields, but it is completely nullified by the enchanted white robe he is wearing—the Fairy King’s gift from the Dullahan. Leonore notices Ryo is wearing the Fairy King's robe and wielding the Fairy King’s sword, instantly marking him as a dangerous target.

The intense battle continues; Leonore uses wind magic to boost her speed and swordsmanship, but Ryo manages to deflect her deadly strikes, noting that her attacks are nothing compared to the rigorous training he received from the Dullahan. Ryo launches multiple icicle lances; Leonore defends herself with rock walls. Ryo changes his strategy, using a high-pressure water jet to cut through her rock defenses and injure her. Leonore is shocked to be hurt, but her injuries heal almost instantly. After she sends him flying into a nearby building, Ryo unleashes his most lethal counterattack: scalding hot water droplets, hotter than boiling temperature, that burn Leonore’s skin and force her to shield herself inside a rock ball.

Just as Leonore prepares a final flame attack, the eclipse ends, and her sword disintegrates as the sun returns, forcing her to halt the fight. Leonore, impressed by the battle, introduces herself and is shocked that Ryo knows what an Akuma is. She warns him not to be killed by anyone else, as she intends to fight him again, before vanishing without a trace. Ryo realizes that the Fairy King's robe was crucial in saving his life, as otherwise, he would have a hole in his shoulder.

Ryo heads to the bank to withdraw cash from the fortune he earned selling the wyvern magic stones. When he returns to the dorms, he finds his new roommates being bullied by higher-ranked F-rank adventurers. Ryo casually blitzes the bullies with precise ice magic, knocking out four of them instantly. He easily dodges the leader’s punch and finishes him off with a light sword-hilt strike to the gut, causing him to vomit up his breakfast. Ryo then advises his friends to increase their stamina and takes them to the public bath to recover. There, Eto uses his priest magic to heal the shoulder wound Ryo sustained from the Akuma battle. Ryo, ever secretive, avoids explaining the injury's origin, promising to tell them later. Ryo, who began his journey distant and reserved, is now noticeably relaxed among his growing circle of friends.

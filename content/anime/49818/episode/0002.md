The episode opens with an explanation about Beyonders: there are 22 Paths, each with their own "Sequences." Sequence 9 is the lowest, and as you ascend, you gain greater powers and move closer to godhood. Following one Path is called walking the Divine Pathway.

Klein decides to accept Dunn's offer. Dunn gives him a name card with the address of a pub and tells him to look for Old Neil Dennis. Klein goes there, follows the instructions, and Dennis guides him into a secret basement that opens into a full underground headquarters — the Nighthawks, a division of the Church of the Evernight Goddess in Tingen. There, Klein is greeted by Leonard Mitchell (the long-haired poet-looking Nighthawk). Leonard explains they’ve been extremely busy with Beyonder-related cases lately. He also tells Klein that Beyonder powers come from drinking mystical potions; the flesh and body parts of Beyonders can be used like raw materials to produce these potions, which is why Beyonders are so dangerous.

The Nighthawks have several Paths available through potions: Sleepless, Arbiter, Seer and Barbarian. They’ve researched the Sleepless Pathway and Arbiter Pathway up to Sequence 7, but for the Seer Pathway, they only have the potion for Sequence 9. Leonard advises Klein not to rush into his choice, and then sends him to Dunn. Along the way, Klein is introduced to several Sequence 9 members in the team.
Dunn tells Klein he’s glad he joined and explains the Nighthawks serve the Goddess of the Night (Evernight Goddess). He sends Klein to the Alchemy Room to receive his potion.

In the Alchemy Room, Klein meets the eccentric old man Old Neil (Dennis Neil), who is an archivist and alchemist. He’s enthusiastic when he learns Klein is a history graduate fluent in Ancient Hermes and Jotun. Neil has Klein help him sort manuscripts while chatting. The conversation shifts to Emperor Roselle Gustav, a legendary and controversial figure in this world. Old Neil proudly shows Klein fragments of Roselle’s lost notebook, claiming he has deciphered some symbols. What he cracked were actually just numbers. From that, he guessed it was a diary.

Klein glances at the diary and, to his shock, realizes it's written in simplified Chinese — his modern-world native script. The entries confirm Roselle was a transmigrator like him. One line he reads says: "I was too rash back then. If I could turn back time, I should have chosen the Pathway of Thief, Seer, or Apprentice."

Old Neil calls Klein’s attention back. Klein quickly pretends he was entranced by trying to decipher the symbols, and Neil laughs it off as youthful arrogance. Neil then asks Klein again which pathway he chooses. Klein confidently replies: Seer Pathway. Neil prepares the potion and Klein drinks it. His awakening causes a major spiritual disturbance, signaling extraordinary potential. Klein gains his Spirit Vision and struggles to stabilize, but eventually succeeds.

Afterward, Klein returns to Dunn, who provides him with basic equipment and pay — an advance of three weeks' salary. Klein feels rich for the first time in this world. His first assigned duty is routine: walking between his house and the Antigonus manor every day, trying to recall details about the missing notebook.

Soon, the Nighthawks receive a mission: the first son of City Councilman Maynard has been kidnapped. Klein and Leonard Mitchell head out by carriage. Klein uses his Seer ability for divination, which guides them to an old building.

Inside, Klein senses the boy behind a certain door, along with two kidnappers. Leonard bursts in dramatically, his Beyonder ability manifesting as scarlet rose petals that swiftly knock down the kidnappers. Klein rushes in, hugs the boy, and leads him out. But suddenly, invisible feathers fall — a ritual activates. The two unconscious kidnappers fuse grotesquely into a monster. Leonard battles the creature fiercely, and at a key moment calls on Klein to fire. Klein, on his very first mission, shoots and lands a hit. Leonard then finishes off the monster.

During the fight, Klein feels a strange familiarity with the building, as if the "original" Klein had been there before. He suspects it has a connection to the Antigonus notebook, but brushes it aside for now. After the mission, Klein returns home thinking of Melissa, imagining how thrilled she'll be when he tells her he found a job with good pay so quickly. But when Klein opens the door to his room, he suddenly finds himself back in that old building instead of his home. Drawn deeper, he reaches a remote corner room. There, on a desk, lies the Antigonus Family Notebook, its last page marked: "Everyone must die, including me."

Klein blacks out. When he comes to, he's sitting at his own desk again, as if nothing happened.

If there’s any scene after this I don’t know, I blacked out too. -author’s note

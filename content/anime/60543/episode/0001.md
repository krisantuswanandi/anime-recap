Right from the start, the episode picks up exactly where Season 1 ended—no wrap-up, no flashbacks, just the action. Momo is relaxing at an open-air hot spring when she’s cornered by creepy men—members of the ominous Kito family. She fights them off with her psychic abilities, causing part of the bath to collapse. But it’s Turbo Granny, hidden in her backpack, who truly rescues her.

At the same time, Okarun and Jiji investigate Jiji’s home. Behind the walls lies a hidden room plastered with talismans. Before they can fully process it, the Kito family shows up—claiming to be the landlords and quickly turning threatening. A random quiz about Jiji’s favorite football team confirms Okarun’s identity—but the family quickly makes their sinister intentions known.

Momo meanwhile ventures to the Tsuchinoko shrine on the hill. There, a self-proclaimed “BooTuber” explains the local legend: a giant serpent whose hunger could trigger a volcanic eruption, quelled by human sacrifices in exchange for the village’s hot springs. Over centuries, the serpent has never gone hungry—maybe because sacrifices still continue.

Back at the house, Momo arrives only to be targeted again. She's assaulted, uses her psychic strength to fight back, and Turbo Granny steps in again—but the showdown intensifies when the matriarch, Naki Kito, forces them into the wall, revealing the horrifying truth: for 200 years, the Kito family has sacrificed innocents to calm a great serpent and keep the village safe. Jiji’s parents were likely victims too.

Chaos erupts when the ground beneath them shifts into quicksand, plunging Momo, Okarun, Jiji, and the Kito family into the belly of a monstrous creature. Momo and the group fall through the house into a lair—an underground domain of the feared entity. As it reveals itself, Turbo Granny corrects the myth: it’s not a serpent, but a Mongolian Death Worm—a giant cryptid worm from the Gobi Desert.

The Kito family, still in ritual mode, make themselves easy prey—soon swallowed by the enormous worm. Left trapped underground, Momo, Okarun, and Jiji scramble to survive. The episode ends on a chilling note: Okarun, wracked by pain and fear, begins transforming into his yokai form, even as Momo and Jiji watch in horror.

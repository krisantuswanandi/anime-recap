The episode plunges us back into chaos immediately. Momo and Okarun, overcome by the Death Worm’s telepathic influence, slide toward a tragic conclusion—attempting to take their own lives. Jiji rushes to pull them away, fighting through terror and urgency to save his friends from both themselves and the monstrous force threatening them.

In the darkest moment, the Evil Eye appears—its intervention both eerie and unexpected. This spirit, once a child victim of the Kito family’s sacrifices, shows up in time to counteract the worm’s lethal effect.

We then dive into the Evil Eye’s tragic past: it was once a child sacrificed to appease the volcano, surviving the ordeal only to be locked away and forgotten. Over time, the Evil Eye became a spirit, observer to countless deaths as families around it succumbed to the worm’s psychic insanity.

Jiji senses something within the spirit—a shared ability to influence minds like the worm. He reaches out with empathy, promising to play with the Evil Eye so it can feel less alone. This act allows the spirit to possess Jiji, granting him a powerful but ominous new form and allowing him to stand against the worm’s influence.

Transforming Jiji into the Evil Eye, we see the spirit’s features—subtle but striking changes signaling the presence of something more than human. In this form, Jiji—now the Evil Eye—fights back against the Death Worm, even protecting his friends with unexpected ferocity.

Amid the horror and action, the episode doesn't lose its balance. Moments of levity—like the characters reacting in chibi form or Turbo Granny’s voice providing a spark of humor—keep the tone grounded even in despair.

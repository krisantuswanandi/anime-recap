The episode opens in chaos: Okarun, transformed into a yokai form (powered by Turbo Granny), is locked in combat with the Evil Eye—an otherworldly entity controlling Jiji. The atmosphere is tense and narrow, like two forces trapped inside a pinball machine of action, with Okarun’s speed clashing against Evil Eye’s sheer strength.

Despite the cramped space, Okarun turns the tide using super-quick, rhythmic punches to shatter Evil Eye’s soul-based structure. His motivation is raw and emotional: anger at the Evil Eye for harming Momo and betraying Jiji's true nature.

Meanwhile, Momo emerges from below ground, scratching her head over a short rope she fashioned from clothes. An intense moment follows: Okarun launches her upward like a projectile in his Turbo Granny form. She grasps a raw, emotional promise from him—he’ll save Jiji, and he’ll save himself too, so she can return to help.

Outside, Momo faces a toxic threat: the worm is releasing poisonous spores. She draws on a childhood memory—Jiji once told her subterranean worms can’t survive prolonged sunlight. A spark of genius ignites: she sets the house on fire and screams for help so firetrucks arrive and douse the ground.

Back inside, the battle continues. Okarun busts through Evil Eye’s defenses, only to get stuck in the worm’s mucus while trying to rescue Turbo Granny, who’s trapped and calling desperately for help.

Above ground, Momo pleads with police and firefighters amidst the chaos. She tries to explain that the Kitos sacrificed innocents to control the worm—but an officer, Tsuru, misunderstands. He claims the Enjoji family owns the house and accuses Momo of arson out of revenge.

Then—sunlight floods the worm’s lair. Momo’s plan works. The Death Worm, allergic to sunlight, dries up and dies. In a gruesome visual, the worm vomits out the Kito family—alive but shaken—who had been swallowed whole.

But victory is short-lived. A sudden tremor shakes the ground. Without warning, the dormant volcano near the village erupts. Lava and ash threaten the town. The episode ends on a high-stakes cliffhanger, tension rising in every direction.
